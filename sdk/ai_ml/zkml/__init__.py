"""
zkML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning) Integration Module.

Provides verifiable ML inference using zero-knowledge proofs.
This surpasses Bittensor which doesn't have zkML support.

Features:
- Proof generation for ML inferences
- Proof verification
- EZKL integration
- Circuit compilation
- Witness generation
- Full compatibility with moderntensor-zkvm (Rust core)
